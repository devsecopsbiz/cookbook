# Lab: Azure DevOps Business

This workshop will guide you through the process of creating and configuring a set of specialized dashboards, each with a different scope that can be used by distinct team members and stakeholders. 

## Azure Cost Insights

It's easy to get your Azure Costs out of control. _Wouldn't it be great to get insights of your infrastructure spending in your daily routine?_

Costs are a concern of everyone, developers, product owners and operations.
They come together in Azure DevOps, so why not show these insights there?

*Azure Cost Insights* is a widget that you can add on your Azure DevOps Dashboard.

This widget is built with the belief that cost insights need to be scoped to your costs. 


### Getting started

You need to create an Azure Pipeline for the widget to work. This pipeline is going to download and host your cost-data, used by the widget.

1. **Create the build pipeline**<br/>

    Navigate to *Pipelines*, *Builds* and *Import a pipeline*.

    Drag and drop the **Cost Insights.json** file, located on the Lab repository under *~/files/Business/*, or Browse for the same file. Then, press *Import* to start the import process:

    After importing, configure the missing settings as following:

    **Pipeline** -> **Agent pool**: Hosted VS2017

    **Get sources** -> **Repository**: SmartHotel360-Website
    
    **Download cost data** -> **Azure RM Subscription**: `Azure subscription being used in the lab`

    When you're finished, your  pipeline will look like this:

2. **Queue the build** and wait for it to finish<br/>

3. **Add the Widget to your Dashboard**<br/>
    - Go to your teams' dashboard and add a 'Azure Cost Insights' widget.

        Navigate back to *Overview*, *Dashboards* and press the **Add a widget** button.

        Then, search for the **Azure Cost Insights** widget and press the **Add** button.

        Configure it by selecting the build we've just created, grouping by *Resource Type* as shown in the image:

        Now add another 'Azure Cost Insights' and configure it as shown below:
