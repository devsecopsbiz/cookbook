## Integrating Microsoft Teams with Azure DevOps Services

**Azure DevOps** integration with Microsoft Teams provides a comprehensive chat and collaborative experience across the development cycle. Teams can easily stay informed of important activities in your Azure DevOps team projects with notifications and alerts on work items, pull requests, code commits, build and release.

1. On the recently created Team, click the ellipsis or **'...'** at the top navigation of your team channel, and then select **Connectors**.

1. Select your organization (you may be prompted to sign in first), the project, and your team. Choose the type of activity you want to be notified about. Depending on the event, you may be given further fields to filter down the notifications so you can filter out notifications your team does not care about. For example, for work item events, you can filter by area path, work item type, and even particular field changes.

## Azure DevOps Kanban board & Dashboards in Teams 

Your Kanban board turns your backlog into an interactive signboard, providing a visual flow of work. As work progresses from idea to completion, you update the items on the board. Each column represents a work stage, and each card represents a user story (blue cards) or a bug (red cards) at that stage of work.

You can bring in your teams kanban board or favourite dashboard directly into Microsoft Teams.
These can be added using Tabs. **Tabs** allow team members to access your service on a dedicated canvas, within a channel or in user's personal app space. You can leverage your existing web app to create a great tab experience within Teams.

1. To bring your Kanban board or Dashboard into Microsoft Teams, click the **+** icon to add new tab. Find the Azure DevOps icon and select **Azure DevOps**

    Repeat steps 1) and 2), and then select **Add a Dashboard**
