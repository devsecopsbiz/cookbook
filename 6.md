## Integrating Microsoft Teams with Azure DevOps Services

**Azure DevOps Services** integration with Microsoft Teams provides a comprehensive chat and collaborative experience across the development cycle. Teams can easily stay informed of important activities in your Azure DevOps team projects with notifications and alerts on work items, pull requests, code commits, build and release.

1. Select **Tailwind Traders** team that was created.  Click the ellipsis or **'...'** at the top nav of your team channel, and then select **Connectors**.

    ![](img/install_connector.png)

1. Select your organization (you may be prompted to sign in first), the project, and your team. Choose the type of activity you want to be notified about. Depending on the event, you may be given further fields to filter down the notifications so you can filter out notifications your team does not care about. For example, for work item events, you can filter by area path, work item type, and even particular field changes.

   When you are happy with the configuration, **Save** it.

1. Since Azure DevOps is configured now, activity from your Azure DevOps Services project will start appearing in your Teams channel.

## Azure DevOps Kanban board & Dashboards in Teams 

Your Kanban board turns your backlog into an interactive signboard, providing a visual flow of work. As work progresses from idea to completion, you update the items on the board. Each column represents a work stage, and each card represents a user story (blue cards) or a bug (red cards) at that stage of work.

You can bring in your teams kanban board or favourite dashboard directly into Microsoft Teams.
These can be added using Tabs. **Tabs** allow team members to access your service on a dedicated canvas, within a channel or in user's personal app space. You can leverage your existing web app to create a great tab experience within Teams.

1. To bring your Kanban board or Dashboard into Microsoft Teams, click the **+** icon to add new tab. Find the Azure DevOps icon and select **Azure DevOps**

   ![](img/add_kanbanboard.png)

   The Kanban board and Dashboard integration has the following limitations:

    1. Only works for Azure DevOps Services (Team Foundation Server is not supported)

    2. Only Kanban boards and Dashboards within organizations in the same organization (Azure Active Directory tenant) as your Microsoft Teams account can be configured." %}
 
1. Once you have authenticated and selected your organization, you will be displayed a screen to select a **Kanban board** or **Dashboard**. 


   ![](img/select_kanbanboard.png)

   Select the **Kanban board** and select your project, team, backlog level. **Save** the configuration.

1. Now you can see the **Kanban Board** appearing in the tab.

## Collaboration Experience

Messages are a good way to connect and keep a history of the conversation. It's even better to use emoji, stickers, and GIFs to make a great impression.

1. Start having conversations with your team members by selecting the **Conversations** tab.

   ![](img/conversations.png)

1. All the conversations could be retrieved at any time without losing the history which helps the entire team to have a collaborative experience

1. Teams can have a collaborative experience with the latest updates with respect to the **work items, build summary** etc so that it helps in better transparency

1. **Easily find and discuss work items from DevOps in Teams** : You can easily search, find and discuss work items from Azure DevOps in Teams, keeping the conversation and collaboration within your Teams app. For example if you would like to discuss about any User Story you can click on **Azure DevOps** icon. It will prompt a window where you can search your project workitems. Select the work item to discuss and enter your comments.

## Working with Channels

**Channels** are dedicated sections within a team to keep conversations organized by specific topics, projects, disciplinesâ€”-whatever works for your team!

- Team channels are places where everyone on the team can openly have conversations. Private chats are only visible to those people in the chat.

- Channels are most valuable when extended with apps that include tabs, connectors, and bots that increase their value to the members of the team.

## Sharing the Contents

As your team works together you'll undoubtedly have files that you'll want to share and collaborate on. Microsoft Teams makes it easy to share files within channels. If the files are Word, Excel. PowerPoint or Visio files your colleagues can even view, edit, and collaborate on the files right within Teams. For Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, they can see each others changes in almost real time.

1. Select **Files** and select **Upload** to share a document with the team. You can also use **Drag and drop** (Using your mouse, drag the file from where it's currently located and drop it on the Teams window among the files.) method to upload files.

   ![](img/upload_files.png)

1. Click on the document that was uploaded from the list to start editing and having a live conversation with your team members

   ![](img/conversation_files.png)

1. You can also share the related websites within the Teams as Tabs. As we use **Wiki** to explain project objectives, epics, specs, release notes, best practices or other content to ensure all your team members and stakeholders learn, you can also share your Team's **[Wiki](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/devops/wiki/)** content as website within teams as tab. 

1. Navigate to your Azure DevOps projects Wiki page. Copy the URL.
       
    ![](img/wikipage.png)

1. Now switch back to the **Teams**. Click on **+** and select **Website**

   ![](img/add_tab.png)

   ![](img/add_website.png)

1. Provide a name for the website, enter the wiki URL copied in previous step and click on **Save**. It appears on the channel where all of the team members can access to get quick information if there were any updates done

    ![](img/wikiasweb.png)

1. This is how the website/Wiki looks when added to the channel.

Now that you have connected Microsoft Teams and Azure DevOps think about the other development team information that you can expose via Microsoft teams, for example: 

- [Add a OneNote notebook to Teams](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-a-OneNote-notebook-to-Teams-0ec78cc3-ba3b-4279-a88e-aa40af9865c2) to keep meeting notes such as **Sprint Planning Meetings** and **Retrospective Meetings**. 
     
    ![](img/onenote.png)

- [Connect Azure DevOps to Power BI ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/report/powerbi/?view=azure-devops) and [add a Power BI tab ](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-a-powerbi-tab-to-teams-708ce6fe-0318-40fa-80f5-e9174f841918) that displays advanced reports from Azure DevOps or other data related to your project.
