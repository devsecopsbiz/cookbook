# Lab: Security

This lab will guide you through adding some Security validations into our pipelines, detecting and fixing security vulnerabilities, but also problematic open source licenses.

## Review WhiteSource Bolt task configurations on Build

*WhiteSource Bolt for Azure DevOps* is a free extension, which scans all your projects and detects open source components, their license and known vulnerabilities.

It covers over 200 programming languages support and continuous tracking of multiple open source vulnerabilities databases like the NVD, security advisories, peer-reviewed vulnerability databases, and popular open source projects issue trackers.

### Let's start adding it to our pipelines

1. In Azure DevOps, click on "Pipelines" on the left menu and then click "Builds"

2. Select the *SmartHotel_Petchecker-Web* and *WhiteSourceBolt* build pipelines, clicking the "Edit" button for each, and select the **WhiteSource Bolt** task. Review it.

## Add OWASP ZAP penetration testing tool to the Release pipeline

OWASP is a worldwide not-for-profit organization dedicated to helping improve the quality of software. ZAP is a free penetration testing tool for beginners to professionals. ZAP includes an API and a weekly docker container image that can be integrated into your deployment process

### Let's start adding it to our pipelines

1. Start by setting up a Docker host for later use:

    ## Deploy a template with the Azure Docker VM extension
    Let's use an existing quickstart template to create an Ubuntu VM that uses the Azure Docker VM extension to install and configure the Docker host.

    You need to login onto the Azure Portal (`https://portal.azure.com`), and access the Cloud Shell, setting it up to *Bash*.

    ![](img/AzureCloudShell.png)

    Since we're using brand new Subscriptions, we need to create a storage to support Cloud Shell.

    Press **Show advanced settings** and fill in **Storage account** and **File share** before hitting the **Create storage** button.
    
    ![](img/CloudShellStorage.png)

    ![](img/CloudShellStorageAdvanced.png)

    After a few seconds you should see something like:

    ![](img/AzureCloudShellBash-ready.png)

    Cloud Shell already provides us the latest Azure CLI, allowing us to execute the following commands.

    First, grab the resource group name (*name* property) already created for the lab. Paste it on notepad for example.

    ```azurecli
    az group list
    ```

    ![](img/RGName.png)

    Next, deploy a VM with that includes the Azure Docker VM extension from an Azure Resource Manager template from GitHub. 

    On the bash cloud shell, run the following command providing, when prompted, your own unique values for *adminUsername*, *adminPassword*, and *dnsNameForPublicIP*.

    > Replace the name of the resource group with the one you got previously.     
    > And *dnsNameForPublicIP* will be your public VM name and must be unique.

    Command to execute:

    ```azurecli
    az group deployment create --resource-group <REPLACE HERE> --template-uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devsecopsbiz/azure-quickstart-templates/f99d00825b32577a5321f4e91ca07e0f914c3aa6/docker-simple-on-ubuntu/azuredeploy.json
    ```

    
    It takes a few minutes for the deployment to finish.


    ## Deploy your first NGINX container
    To view details of your VM, including the DNS name, use *az vm show*:

    > Replace the name of the resource group with the one you got previously

    ```azurecli
    az vm show --resource-group <REPLACE HERE> --name myDockerVM --show-details --query [fqdns] --output tsv
    ```

    SSH to your new Docker host. **Provide your own** username and DNS name from the preceding steps:

    ```
    ssh <azureuser>@<mypublicdns.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com>
    ```

    Once logged in to the Docker host, let's run an NGINX container:

    ```
    sudo docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx
    ```

    The output is similar to the following example as the NGINX image is downloaded and a container started:

    ```
    Unable to find image 'nginx:latest' locally
    latest: Pulling from library/nginx
    efd26ecc9548: Pull complete
    a3ed95caeb02: Pull complete
    a48df1751a97: Pull complete
    8ddc2d7beb91: Pull complete
    Digest: sha256:2ca2638e55319b7bc0c7d028209ea69b1368e95b01383e66dfe7e4f43780926d
    Status: Downloaded newer image for nginx:latest
    b6ed109fb743a762ff21a4606dd38d3e5d35aff43fa7f12e8d4ed1d920b0cd74
    ```

    Check the status of the containers running on your Docker host as follows:

    ```
    sudo docker ps
    ```

    The output is similar to the following example, showing that the NGINX container is running and TCP ports 80 and 443 and being forwarded:

    ```
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                         NAMES
    b6ed109fb743        nginx               "nginx -g 'daemon off"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp, 443/tcp   adoring_payne
    ```

    To see your container in action, open up a web browser and enter the DNS name of your Docker host:

    ![](img/nginx.png)


2. Before proceeding any further, let's run a OWASP ZED Attack Proxy against our published website.

    > Note: Replace the website URI with the one you've deployed earlier. e.g. *https://smarthotel360lcu4bmxi7kl4w.azurewebsites.net* 

    ```
    docker run -v $(pwd):/zap/wrk/:rw -t owasp/zap2docker-weekly zap-baseline.py -t <REPLACE HERE> -g gen.conf -r testreport.html
    ```
    Docker image will be pulled and the container will be then executed.

    ![](img/OWASP-docker-pull.png)

    When if finishes you should see a summary like this

    ![](img/OWASP-finish.png)

    
3. Navigate back to your Azure DevOps Project and let's grab a personal access token (PAT) we'll be needing later on.
    > Save that PAT token, it can't be retrieved later

    3.1 Navigate to the user profile and select *Security*

    ![](img/PAT-token-security.png)

    3.2 Select *Personal access token*

    ![](img/PAT-token-navigate.png)

    3.3 Create a new personal access token

    ![](img/PAT-token-create.png)

    3.4 Copy the token, making sure you don't lose it.

    ![](img/PAT-token.png)

4. On your Azure DevOps project, navigate to *Pipelines*, *Releases* *SmartHotel360_Website-Deploy*, and press the **Edit** button.

    Then, under *Variables*, add a new variable setting:

    **Name:** PAT

    **Value:** <copied PAT token>

    **Secret:** press the locker button, making it a secret, hiding the contents

    You should get the following configuration:

    ![](img/PAT-token-variable.png)

    Save the release pipeline.


4. Let's get back to the Release pipeline and add some extra tasks to launch the ZAP test and grab the results.
Start by adding two **SSH** tasks, one for running the tests and another for publishing the test report to a public website. 

    Under `Pipeline`, add a new Artifact, from the *owasp-zap-vsts-extension* build, as shown in the following image:

    ![](img/Artifact-owasp-zap-vsts-extension.png)

    > Important: make sure your *Source alias* for this artifact is **_owasp-zap-vsts-extension**

    Now, *view stage tasks*: 

    ![](img/Add-OWASP-tasks-navigate.png)

    4.1. Before going further we need to configure the SSH service connection to the provisioned Docker machine.
    Press the *Manage* button, *New service connection*, *SSH*, and fill in the following details, replacing *Host name*, *User name* and *Password* with your own details, specified on the previous steps of this lab.

    ![](img/SSH-service-connection.png)

    Press *OK* and go back to the previous tab, on the release pipeline. Refresh the *SSH service connection* drop down and select the fresh new connection. 

    4.2. For the first `SSH` task, we need to specify the command to run and check the `Continue on error` option. This is required due to possible failing tests, that we don't want to prevent the deployment to proceed.

    ![](img/SSH-ZAP-test.png)

    > Tip: Rename `Display name` to make it clearer to understand what is going on here.

    Change the URI with the value of your own website, published on the previous Labs, and copy the updated command:

    ```
    docker run -v $(pwd):/zap/wrk/:rw -t owasp/zap2docker-weekly zap-baseline.py -t $(SmartHotelWebsiteURL) -g gen.conf -r $(Release.DefinitionName)_$(Release.ReleaseName)_OwaspZapReport.html
    ```

    4.3. On the second `SSH` task insert the following command:

    ```
    docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
    docker run -v $(pwd):/usr/share/nginx/html -d -p 80:80 nginx
    ```

    This will copy the generated test report to the NGINX container, making it publicly available.
    Rename the *Display name* as suggested before, making it clearer to understand in the future.

    4.4. Next we'll be adding a *Powershell* task to download the generated test report and pass into the release pipeline.

    Add the following command to download the file, changing the *URI* on both commands.

    ```
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://<msreadydockervm>.<eastus>.cloudapp.azure.com/$(Release.DefinitionName)_$(Release.ReleaseName)_OwaspZapReport.html" -OutFile "$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)\OwaspZapReport.html"
    ```

    ![](img/Powershell-Download.png)
   
   4.5. To finish, add a *Command Line* task, were we'll be executing the **owasp-zap-vsts-tool.exe** to attach the report into Azure DevOps.

    ![](img/Add-OWASP-tasks-search.png)

5. Paste this command on the *Script* text box as seen in the image, adapting the URI on the Echo command. 

    ```
    $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/_owasp-zap-vsts-extension/drop/owasp-zap-vsts-tool/bin/Release/owasp-zap-vsts-tool.exe attachreport collectionUri="$(System.TeamFoundationCollectionUri)" teamProjectName="$(System.TeamProject)" releaseUri=$(Release.ReleaseUri) releaseEnvironmentUri=$(Release.EnvironmentUri) filepath=$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)\OwaspZapReport.html personalAccessToken=$(PAT)

    echo "http://<msreadydockervm>.<eastus>.cloudapp.azure.com/$(Release.DefinitionName)_$(Release.ReleaseName)_OwaspZapReport.html"
    ```

    ![](img/OWASP-Attach-Report.png)

6. To finish the Security Lab, run the release pipeline and, when it has finished, navigate to your website made available using NGINX.
You can check the URI by navigating to the *Attach Report* task log:

    ![](img/OWASP-Attach-Report-Navigate.png)

    You should see something like:

    ![](img/NGINX-ZAP-Report.png)
