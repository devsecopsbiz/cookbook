## R-AIST307-P1: Dev*Ops: Hands on DevSecOps and DevOpsBiz cookbook 

**Welcome to Dev*Ops: Hands on DevSecOps and DevOpsBiz cookbook!**

DevOps has been propagating throughout the world as the place to be in order to be Agile and successful. 
As maturity sets in, new challenges start to come up, namely the security role and the integration with the business teams. 
As such, buzz words like _DevSecOps_ and even _DevSecOpsBiz_ are becoming more popular in discussions. 

This lab session builds on top of _R-AIST216 Dev*Ops: Digging into the trends of DevSecOps and DevOpsBiz_, allowing you to experience first hand the construction of a real world scenario.
