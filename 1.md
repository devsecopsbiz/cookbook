# Lab: Azure DevOps CI/CD

This lab will guide you through building Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines with Azure DevOps. The build pipeline will make use of a Java application, built with Maven, but also a .NET Core and Azure Functions App.
For the release pipeline we'll be leveraging ARM templates and Azure App Services to host our application.

## Create Build Pipeline

* Navigate to *Pipelines*, *Builds*.

    ### WhiteSource Bolt Build
    1. Here you should see an existing build definition name *WhiteSourceBolt*.
    Under *New*, select *Import a pipeline* to import a precooked pipeline to build the recently imported SmartHotel repository:

        ![](img/AzureDevOpsLab-Builds-02.png)
        
    2. Drag and drop the `SmartHotel_Petchecker-Web.json` file, located on the Lab repository under *~/files/SmartHotel/*, or Browse for the same file. Then, press *Import* to start the import process:

        ![](img/AzureDevOpsLab-Builds-03.png)

        ```
        Change the Name, removing the "-import" portion of it.
        The final name should be "SmartHotel_Petchecker-Web", as shown in the image:
        ``` 

        ![](img/AzureDevOpsLab-Builds-031.png)
    
    3. Select the **Hosted VS2017** Agent pool:

        ![](img/AzureDevOpsLab-Builds-04.png)
  
    4. Now select the *Source Repository* `SmartHotel360-Website`, by pressing *Get sources*, *Azure Repos Git* and selecting the correct repository on the *Repository* dropdown:

        ![](img/AzureDevOpsLab-Builds-05.png)

    5. To finish, enable the *Continuous integration* trigger by navigating to *Triggers* and selecting *Enable continuous integration*:

        ![](img/AzureDevOpsLab-Builds-trigger.png)

        Save by pressing the **Save** button, confirming the save on the popup (no need to change anything on the *Select folder* or add a Comment):

        ![](img/Save.png)

    ### OWASP Build
    
    Now we'll be using an alternative way to setup our CI build, leveraging a YAML file.

    Navigate to the *owasp-zap-vsts-extension* repository, and drag and drop the **azure-pipelines.yml** file, located on the Lab contents you've downloaded, under *~/files/OWASP*, into the repository.

    ![](img/OWASP-pipeline-dragdrop.png)

    Click on the **Commit** button to confirm.

    ![](img/OwaspBuildConfirmCommit.png)

    You should end up with the following contents:

    ![](img/OWASP-pipeline.png)

    This will generate an additional build pipeline, now available together with the remaining ones.
    Navigate back to *Pipelines*, *Builds* to double check:

## Create Release Pipeline

* Under *Pipelines*, navigate to *Releases* and press **New pipeline**

    ![](img/AzureDevOpsLab-Releases-01.png)

    1. We first need to create a dummy, empty, Release pipeline in order for the *Import* to become available. 
    Let's do this by pressing *New pipeline*, *Empty job* and **Save**:

        ![](img/AzureDevOpsLab-Releases-02.png)

        ![](img/AzureDevOpsLab-Releases-04.png)

    2. Navigate back to *All pipelines* and select **Import release pipeline**:

        ![](img/AzureDevOpsLab-Releases-05.png)

    3. Drag and drop, or navigate as before, to select the **SmartHotel360_Website-Deploy.json** file:

        ![](img/AzureDevOpsLab-Releases-06.png)

    4. Press *OK* to start the import process. You should now have a release pipeline like this:

        ![](img/AzureDevOpsLab-Releases-07.png)

    5. Navigate to the Stage tasks:

        ![](img/AzureDevOpsLab-Releases-08.png)

    6. Select the *Agent job*, and set the *Agent pool* to **Hosted**

        ![](img/ReleasePipeline_SetAgentPool.png)

    7. Select the first task and, under *Azure Subscription*, select the **Manage** button.
    It will redirect you to a page were we'll be configuring access to the Resource Group from our Azure Subscription.

        ![](img/AzureDevOpsLab-Releases-09.png)

        Under `New service connection`, select `Azure Resource Manager`:

        ![](img/ServiceConnections.png)

        Select the available *resource group* from the dropdown, give the service connection a name and press OK.

        > Important: Save the Resource Group name for later use (copy to notepad for example).

        ![](img/ServiceConnectionConfig.png)

        You should then see a new Service connection appear:

        ![](img/ServiceConnectionFinish.png)

 
    8. Going back to the *release pipeline* (should be on a previous tab on the browser), the dropdown should now show you the brand new *Service connection*.

        Select it.
        > If it hasn't loaded, press the refresh button on the right and then open the dropdown again.

        ![](img/AzureSubscriptionAvailable.png)


        Step in each one of the tasks with error, selecting and authorizing an Azure Subscription to use in the lab. 

        > For the *ARM Outputs* task in particular, it's also required to specify the *Azure Connection Type* as **Azure Resource Manager**

    9. Navigate to *Variables* and update the values.

        **location:** West US

        **ResourceGroup:** <paste the resource group we've saved earlier: e.g. ResourceGroupXXXXX>

        ![](img/VariablesUpdate.png)

    10. Remove the existing *Artifact* by navigating back to the *Pipeline* tab, selecting the Artifact, and pressing *Delete*.

        ![](img/RemoveArtifact.png)

    11. Now, add the **SmartHotel_Petchecker-Web** build artifact. This will make sure we're using the artifact coming from the build we've created before.

        > Important: set the *Source alias* to `SmartHotel Petchecker Web`

        ![](img/AddArtifact.png)

    12. To finish, enable the Continuous Deployment trigger

        ![](img/AzureDevOpsLab-Releases-trigger.png)

    13. Press the **Save** button, confirming with the **OK** button.
    > Important: Set the release pipeline name to **SmartHotel360_Website-Deploy**


#### Run a test build

1. In Azure DevOps, click on Builds and, for each build, select it and press the "Queue" button on the right upper corner.

    ![](img/TestQueueBuilds.png)

2. Monitor the build logs, by double clicking the running build, and wait for it to complete

   ![](img/AzureDevOpsLab-Builds-Run-end.png)

3. The release will be triggered automatically when the build is complete (be patient, this can take some time). Review the results as it completes. 

   ![](img/AzureDevOpsLab-Releases-Run-executing.png)

4. Navigate to the release logs and check the details regarding the last step, **Echo Website Name**.

   ![](img/AzureDevOpsLab-Releases-CheckOutput-deploytask.png)

    Here you should see the website URL. Press <Ctrl> and click on the URL to navigate to it.

    ![](img/AzureDevOpsLab-Releases-CheckOutput-1.png)

    The website we've just deployed looks like :

    ![](img/AzureDevOpsLab-Releases-CheckOutput-site.png)


7. Now kick-off the full CI/CD pipeline by making an edit to the  code in the Azure DevOps code repository.
Navigate back to *Repos*, *SmartHotel360-Website* repository, select **appsettings.Development.json** and press *Edit*

    ![](img/AzureDevOpsLab-Repo-edit.png)

8. Change the *Name* property value to something you want, and *Commit* the change after it
