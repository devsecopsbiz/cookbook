# Lab: Create Azure DevOps Project 

This lab will guide you through the initial setup of an Azure DevOps Project, providing a quicker, prebuilt setup.

The first required step is to clone the public GitHub repository where the Lab is hosted.
This will allow you to have access to several pre-prepared assets, necessary for the different Lab modules we'll be implementing.

On the lab windows, press the *Windows* start menu and search for *x64_x86 Cross Tools Prompt for VS 2017*, launching it in *Administrator mode*.

```
git clone https://github.com/devsecopsbiz/technical-lab.git
```

And you will get all the content on the *C:\technical-lab* folder, as shown in the image:
